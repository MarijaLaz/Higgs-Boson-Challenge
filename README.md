# ML-2020
PROJECT repository for Machine Learning course EPFL 2020

project 1 
	Start 24/09
	Due   26/10


Before git pull:
	git status -> check what is changed
	
For removing the checkpoints:
	git rm <PATH for the checkpoint> 

I added the checkpoints into the .gitignore file, so when we add changed files to the repository we just use:
	git add -u
	
Let's try this way, if there are errors we will find another solution.
