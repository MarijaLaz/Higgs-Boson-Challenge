Notes for project


Deborah:
- which loss function to use? mse, rmse?  -> RMSE
- all fct losses at implementation file


Strategy:
Feature processing
- According to the correlation matrix, we delete the variables that have p>= 0.9
- Standardization
    - No standardization is needed for regression models -> stadardize would change de matrix and give possibly the wrong w
    - Standardization should be used only for GD types of models
- Feature expansion ? 


Apply methods
- Ridge regression to learn 
- find the good lambda
- Train other models compared to ridge regression
    - find good parameters (gamma, max_iter, ... ) 


Validating
- Cross validation
